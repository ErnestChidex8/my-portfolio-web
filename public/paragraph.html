    <h4>
        <p>
        First paragraph: I want to recommend Dick for the hard work he has put in both as an
        author and as a coach. The amount of influence Mr. Bolles has had on
        people in career transition, such as myself when the dot-com bubble burst,
        is immeasurable….His sage wisdom has forever changed my life, and I            insist that all future employees read the Parachute book.
        </p>
        <p>
        Second paragraph: Dick Bolles is the last person on earth who needs my recommendation.
        Everyone knows his value to the world of career development. My
        recommendation/gratitude is for his friendship. He’s a wonderful human
        being, joyful, resilient, and generous.
        </p>
        <p>
        Third paragraph: The people who can educate employees and job seekers on how to really
        find jobs (and careers) are career counselors and career coaches. Ideally, a
        good coach should buy copies of Parachute at wholesale and give a copy            to every one of their paying clients
